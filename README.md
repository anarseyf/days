## Days Countdown

This app lets you count down a number of days, up to one year. Optionally select the start date (defaults to today). Easy-to-use, low-friction interface.

* Calendar to select a start date
* Notification on the last day of countdown (at 7:00AM, can be changed or turned off).
* Bars to illustrate days passed (see screenshots)
